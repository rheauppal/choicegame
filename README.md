Reaction based game 

I was prepping for an interview that supposedly had reaction based games, on searching the interent, I could not find a place to practice therefore I coded it. 

1) It calculates average reaction time
2) Calculates no of wrong responses
3) Calculates a score that is based on how fast a reaction time was and has negative scoring for wrong responses

Future steps: 
1) Exchange the colors of the shapes
2) exchange the keys
3) exchange the color and the keys
